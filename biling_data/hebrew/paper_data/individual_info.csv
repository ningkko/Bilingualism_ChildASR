General Instructions,,for data input,,,,,
,,,,,,,
Code ,,= any ID code for the child you have used in your study (e.g. PL01= is the first child in the Polish study),,,,,
Gender: ,,1 = female; 2 = male,,,,,
Age,,please enter the age in months ,,,,,
Age Band ,,1= <24 months; 2= 24-30 months;  3 = 30-36 months,,,,,
,,,,,,,
Language Exposure measures:,,,,,,,
Age of Exposure to L1 (Hebrew) and L2 (English),,,,please enter in months,,,
Frequency of exposure to L1 (please define your L1) and give exact frequency from 0-4 as reported by parents,,,,,,,
Frequency of exposure to L2 (please define your L2) and give exact frequency from 0-4 as reported by parents,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,
"(For Developmental and Language Background Questionnaire Section 2.9; Never = 0, Rarely = 1 ,Sometimes = 2, Usually = 3, Always = 4)",,,,,,,
"(For Questionnaire for Parents of Bilingual Children (PaBi Questionnaire), see Section 2.7: Never = 0, Rarely = 1 ,Sometimes = 2, Usually = 3, Always = 4)",,,,,,,
"Risk factors for language delay: Parent concern; Freq ear infections; NO 2 word combinations; Low birth weight;  Family History (only positive if sibling, father or mother has difficulties)",,,,,,,
"0= no (i.e. no concern/ no ear infections/ is combining words at 24 months; not low birth (not <1500g); no family history etc.) 1= yes (i.e. parent is concerned; has frequent ear infectoins, is NOT combining words at 24 months, has a low birth weight (<1500g) etc)",,,,,,,
,,,,,,,
VOCABULARY SCORES,,,,,,,
Total L1 and % L1 (L1 words expressed as a percentage of total number of L1 words on checklist) and the same for L2,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,
Total Vocabulary – this involves just adding up all the words the child can say in L1 and L2 with the Non-specific Language (NSL) words. Extra added words from parents are NOT counted,,,,,,,
"% Total Vocabulary - this is the Total Vocabulary score expressed as a percentage of the total number of L1, L2 and NSL words used by the child",,,,,,,
,,,,,,,
Total Conceptual Vocabulary,,,,,,,
 = Total Vocabulary minus No. of translational equivalent pairs that the child says. ,,,,,,,
"e.g. if the child says ‘chien’ and ‘dog’; ‘merci’ but not ‘thank you’ and ‘go’ but not ‘aller’,  their total vocabulary would be 4, but their total conceptual vocabulary would be 4 – 1(chien & dog) = 3.",,,,,,,
,,,,,,,
Translation Equivalent Pairs,,,,,,,
"This also needs to be included as a variable, computed by subtracting TCV from TV",,,,,,,
,,,,,,,
Non-Specific Language Words,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,
Non-specific language words (words which cannot be assigned to either language) include: Cognates/ Homophones/ Proper Nouns/ Words no explicitly named in the checklist such as names for male/female body parts),,,,,,,
"If NSL words are included in your CDI/s, the Total Vocabulary = L1 Vocabulary + L2 Vocabulary +  Number of NSL words",,,,,,,
